<!--
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

            <h3>Who can participate at UNIHACK?</h3>
            <p>
              UNIHACK is open to all students currently enrolled in a Victorian university or
              TAFE (not just those in the University of Melbourne or Monash University). The
              event is open to students of all majors and minors - so you do not need to have
              a Computer Science or Software Engineering degree to participate.
            </p>
            <h3>How many people can I have in a team?</h3>
            <p>
              You can have up to four people in our team. You can also work on a project by yourself
              (i.e. a team of one person), but we encourage you collaborate with others to get the full
              hackathon experience.
            </p>
            <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p>
              You will need to bring a laptop, your mobile phone and chargers for both. It is
              also suggested that you bring a sleeping bag, pillow and a change of clothes for
              the next day. Also, don't forget to bring yourself and your teammates!
            </p>
            <p>
              Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> bring illegal drugs, alcohol, firearms or any other
              weapon.
            </p>

            <h3>Will there be any internet access during UNIHACK?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, there will be wireless internet available during UNIHACK - courtesy from our location partners,
              York Butter Factory. You will be given the wireless password when you arrive.
            </p>


          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Can I start working on my project before UNIHACK?</h3>
            <p>
              No. Teams should do all the development work during the 24 hour period. Because of the compressed
              time frame, we do allow teams to research the tools, concepts and ideas of your project beforehand.
            </p>

            <h3>Do I need to stay for the entire 24 hours?</h3>
            <p>
              No, you do not. We understand if people would like to sleep on a comfortable bed instead of the
              floor. Participants are able to stay and leave during the 24 hours - just make sure your team
              knows where you are.
            </p>

            <h3>Why are the presentations held on a Monday night?</h3>
            <p>
              Because we wanted to give teams the Sunday to rest before presenting their idea, because doing
              <em>anything</em> - even pitching your idea to the judges - after staying up for 24 hours is
              not fun. <a href="http://cyberchallenge.com.au">We should know.</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Who owns what gets made at UNIHACK?</h3>
            <p>
              Any intellectual property (e.g. code, images, audio) that you and/or your team create during UNIHACK
              belongs to you and/or your team.
            </p>

            <h3>What do I do if I have more questions?</h3>
            <p>
              Feel free to email your questions to
              <a href="mailto:fits@monashclubs.org">fits@monashclubs.org</a>.
